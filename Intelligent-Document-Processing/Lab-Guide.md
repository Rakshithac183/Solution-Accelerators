# Intelligent Document Processing Solution Accelerator

Many organizations process different format of forms in various format. These forms go through a manual data entry process to extract all the relevant information before the data can be used by software applications. The manual processing adds time and opex in the process. The solution described here demonstrate how organizations can use Azure cognitive services to completely automate the data extraction and entry from pdf forms. The solution highlights the usage of the  **Form Recognizer** and **Azure Cognitive Search**  cognitive services. The pattern and template is data agnostic i.e. it can be easily customized to work on a custom set of forms as required by a POC, MVP or a demo. The demo also scales well through different kinds of forms and supports forms with multiple pages. 

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](/images/architecture.png)

## Process-Flow

* Receive forms from Email or upload via the custom web application
* The logic app will process the email attachment and persist the PDF form into blob storage
  * Uploaded Form via the UI will be persisted directly into blob storage
* Event grid will trigger the Logic app (PDF Forms processing)
* Logic app will
  * Convert the PDF (Azure function call)
  * Classify the form type using Custom Vision
  * Perform the blob operations organization (Azure Function Call)
* Cognitive Search Indexer will trigger the AI Pipeline
  * Execute standard out of the box skills (Key Phrase, NER)
  * Execute custom skills (if applicable) to extract Key/Value pair from the received form
  * Execute Luis skills (if applicable) to extract custom entities from the received form
  * Execute CosmosDb skills to insert the extracted entities into the container as document
* Custom UI provides the search capability into indexed document repository in Azure Search

## Deployment

Note: Most of the resources of this solution would have been already deployed.

### STEP 0 - Before you start (Pre-requisites)

These are the key pre-requisites to deploy this solution:
1. When you access the lab, a virtual machine will startup with the PowerShell logon task.


![Log on task](/images/logon-task-start.jpg)

2. While the powershell logon task runs in background, log in to the Azure portal using the **Microsoft Edge browser** shortcut and the credentials provided in the lab guide.

3. In the welcome window that appears, please select **Maybe Later**. 


![Portal Maybe Later](/images/maybe-later-azure-homepage.jpg)

4. Now, select the **Resource groups** icon under **Navigate**. 


![Open RGs](/images/idp-azure-home-page.jpg)

5. Open the **Intelligent** resource group that we will use for the rest of this demo.


![Select Intelligent RG](/images/select-RG.jpg)

6. You will notice there are already few resources present. 


![Few resources present in RG](/images/few-resources.jpg)

7. Go back to the PowerShell window and wait for a few minutes as we manually need to authorize two API connections.




### STEP 1 - Authorize Event Grid API Connection


1. Wait for the step in the script that states **STEP 12 - Create API Connection and Deploy Logic app**.


![Step 12 API Yellow](/images/Step12.jpg)

2. We need to authorize the API connection in two minutes. Once you see the message **Authorize idp<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />aegpi API Connection** in yellow, go to **Intelligent** resource group. 


![Authorize aegapi Yellow](/images/aegapi-authorize-yellow.jpg)

3. Search for the **idp<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />aegapi** resource in the search tab and click on it. This will now take you to a API connection page. 


![select aegapi in RG](/images/search-select-aegapi.jpg)

4. In the API connection blade, select **Edit API connection**. 


![edit aegapi](/images/edit-aegapi-blade.jpg)

5. Click on **Authorize** button to authorize. 


![Authorize aegapi](/images/authorize-aegapi-button.jpg)

6. In the new window that pops up, select the ODL/lab account. 


![Select Account](/images/aegapi-authorize-window.jpg)

7. **Save** ***(1)*** the connection and check for the notification stating **Successfully edited API connection** ***(2)***.


![Save aegapi connection](/images/aegapi-save.jpg)

8. Now go back to the **Overview** page and verify if the status shows **Connected**, else click on **Refresh** a few times as there could be some delays in the backend. 


![Verify aegapi connection](/images/verify-aegapi-connected.jpg)

9. When the status shows **Connected**, come back to the PowerShell window and click on any key to continue when you see the message **Press any key to continue**. 


![Continue after aegapi connection](/images/aegapi-press-continue.jpg)




### STEP 2 - Authorize Office 365 API Connection

1. We need follow the same procedure to authorize the Office 365 API as we did for the Event Grid API. We have to authorize the API connection in two minutes. Once you see the message **Authorize idp<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />o365api API Connection** in yellow, go to **Intelligent** resource group. 


![Authorize office365 api Yellow](/images/authorize-officeapi-yellow.jpg)

2. Search for the **idp<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />o365api** resource in the resources search tab and click on it. This will now take you to a API connection page. 


![select office365 api in RG](/images/Search-select-OfficeAPI.jpg)

3. In the API connection blade, select **Edit API connection**. 


![edit office365 api](/images/officeapi-edit-connection.jpg)

4. Click on **Authorize** button to authorize. 


![Authorize office365 api](/images/officeapi-authorize-button.jpg)

5. In the new window that pops up, select the ODL/lab account. 


![Select Account](/images/officeapi-authorize-window.jpg)

6. **Save** ***(1)*** the connection and check for the notification stating **Successfully edited API connection** ***(2)***. 


![Save office365 api connection](/images/officeapi-save.jpg)

7. Now go back to the **Overview** page and verify if the status shows **Connected**, else click on **Refresh** a few times as there could be some delays in the backend. 


![Verify office365 api connection](/images/officeapi-verify-connected.jpg)

8. When the status shows **Connected**, come back to the PowerShell window and click on any key to continue when you see the message **Press any key to continue**.


![Continue after office365 api connection](/images/officeapi-continue.jpg)


We have now authorized both the API connections. Go back to the PowerShell window and wait for the script execution to complete. Note that the PowerShell window will close once the script execution completes. Please wait for 10 minutes after the PowerShell run is complete, and then proceed to the next step.



## Acessing the Search UI

1. Go back to the **Intelligent** resource group. Then, search and select **idp<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />webapp**. 


![Select cognitive search RG](/images/SearchSelect-Webapp-RG.jpg)

5. You can use the **Search tab** for searching the words from the forms uploaded and even explore each of the text cognitive skills by selecting them. 


![Search tab](/images/text-cognitive-skills.jpg)

6. We can even upload the files manually to cognitive search. Click on **Upload files** in the top menu bar, this will provide you with a user interface to upload the files. 


![Upload Files](/images/upload-files.jpg)

7. Drag and drop files into the red zone to add them to the upload list, or click anywhere within the red block to open a file dialog. 


![Drag drop files](/images/drag-drop-files.jpg)

8. Select the file to upload and wait for 5 minutes as the cognitive search enrichment pipeline runs every 5 minutes.
